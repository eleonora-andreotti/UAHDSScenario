# UAHDSScenario
This material is a supplement to our paper "Mathematical Definitions of Scene and Scenario for Analysis of Automated Driving Systems in Mixed-Traffic Simulations," in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 2020. (E. Andreotti, P. Boyraz, Selpi).

In the file UAHDriveSetScenario_SupMat.pdf is presented the case study analysed, while in the file UAHDriveSetScenario_Guide.pdf is explained how to generate the scenario using our code in SUMO.
